## Objective: Generate UI Design Variations

Your task is to create three distinct visual variations of a given UI design. While the aesthetics should be different for each version, the core functionality and content hierarchy must remain consistent with the source.

### Source Material

*   **Reference Design**: A source HTML file will be provided. Analyze its structure, content, and functionality.
*   **Style Guide**: Use the design tokens and component styles defined in `designs/design.json` as a foundation for styling.

### Requirements

1.  **Generate 3 Variations**: Create three separate HTML files named `design1.html`, `design2.html`, and `design3.html`.
2.  **Visual Diversity**: Each variation should have a unique look and feel. Experiment with different colors, typography, spacing, and layout arrangements based on the available design tokens.
3.  **Functional Consistency**: Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links, forms) and the overall information architecture are preserved from the source design.
4.  **Adhere to Design System**: All styling must originate from or be consistent with the `designs/design.json` file. Do not introduce new, one-off styles.

### Final Output

Produce three standalone HTML files: `design1.html`, `design2.html`, and `design3.html`.
